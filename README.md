# rust-dev-setup
A quick way to setup a rust development environment on Linux (Mint)

I created this script to get a little practice writing a simple shell script (that I haven't done in a while) and to give myself a repeatable process for getting a relatively simple Rust dev environment setup with.

This is additionally something that I can share with others so that they can use it and follow along with some projects I am using to discover and learn Rust as a programming language.

Enjoy!
